# The Data struture

The dataset consisted of seven tables including informations about customer, sales, product, stores, stores country,target,dates. One table was added after crossing and using DAX functions in order to have in depth informations for our future dashboards: we named it Table_Target_Par_Annee_Pays.

# RESLUTS

The given data was already cleared and organized so our main job was enssentially to produce the differents dashboards and make sure to highlight the most useful insights. 
To do so, we drew on our knowledge of the Power BI tool and the DAX functions to link and structure the data that would enable us to achieve our objectives listed above. 

Following the dashboards which were produced during this work:

-->Recommendation: Keep Computers as a core driver, but design growth initiatives for mid-tier categories to avoid overreliance.

  # CONCLUSION

  This project explored **Contoso‚Äôs commercial performance** through a series of interactive dashboards built with Power BI.  
The analysis covered multiple dimensions: sales trends, regional performance, top vs flop stores, product categories, customer segments, and profitability.  

**Key contributions of this work:**  
- Provided a **clear, data-driven overview** of sales and profit evolution over 7 years.  
- Identified **growth drivers** (Computers category, Online channel, US market) and **weak points** (France, Retail underperformance, brand gaps).  
- Designed actionable recommendations to **diversify revenue streams**, **optimize underperforming regions**, and **leverage best practices** from top managers and products.  

Beyond descriptive analytics, this project emphasizes the importance of **data storytelling**: turning raw numbers into **business insights** and **strategic decisions**.  

üöÄ **Next steps** could include:  
- Integrating **predictive analytics** (forecasting sales & churn).  
- Exploring **customer segmentation & cohort analysis** to refine marketing strategies.  
- Automating refresh pipelines for a fully operational BI system.
